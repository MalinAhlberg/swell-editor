        <h1>SweLL normalisation tool manual</h3>

<h3>General remarks</h3>
<ul>
<li>The upper text area is the learner text, and cannot be edited.</li>
<li>The middle section is the graph of the normalisation and labels for current sentence.</li>
<li>The lower text area is where you normalise the text.</li>
<li>Below these are buttons exposing various functionality. Feel free to experiment! Press all buttons until you know what they do. No need to be afraid: nothing will break.</li>
<li>Press <tt>ctrl-z</tt> to undo</li>
<li>Change text to work on using the dropdown. It's initially set to <i>examples</i> when you've logged in.</li>
<li>Unfortunately I cannot guarantee that anything works in Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge or Safari. I recommend using either of these browsers:
  <ul>
   <li>Firefox: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/</a></li>
   <li>Chrome:  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">https://www.google.com/chrome/</a></li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Editing within a word</h3>
Place the cursor where you want to edit and just type what you want it to become.
If you are replacing the whole word select it first. This is what happens in the example video below:

<h3>Separating words</h3>
Insert a space to separate words:

<h3>Merging words</h3>
Remove space to merge words:

<h3>Changing word order using drag and drop</h3>
You can use drag and drop to change the word order. First select one of the words. Start dragging it
by holding down the mouse button and hold it down until you drop it at the location you want it.

<h3>Changing word order using cut and paste</h3>
Cut and paste can be used to change the word order instead. Select the word or phrase you want to move,
press <tt>ctrl-x</tt> (if you're on a Mac that's <tt>cmd-x</tt>). The selection is then shown
with a special outline. Go to the place where you want to paste it and press
<tt>ctrl-v</tt> (Mac: <tt>cmd-v</tt>)

<h3>Removing by disconnecting</h3>
Remove a redundant word by first <it>disconnecting</it> it (by pressing the button or <tt>ctrl-d</tt>)
and then remove it by selecting it and pressing backspace.

<h3>Removing by double click in the graph</h3>
You can double-click on a word in the learner text or the source text to disconnect from its label.
This leads to the same state as the last section.

<h3>Disconnect</h3>
If too

<h3>Drag and drop inside the graph</h3>
If too many words gets jumbled together one way to establish order is to
first disconnect them, by double-clicking in the graph.
You can then drag-and-drop in the graph to join components together.

<h3>Comma order</h3>
The previous example can be done more easily by first inserting the comma after the period and
then removing the period. This way no unwanted links are created.

<h3>Labelling</h3>
To start labelling, press in the graph where you want to put labels.
A window will appear to the left with all the codes. You activate an code by
clicking on it. Use many codes if needed. You deactivate a code by clicking on it again.

<h3>Labelling with keyboard</h3>
You can also add labels with the keyboard by writing into the text field in the label menu to the
left. This has the advantage that you can go to the next word by pressing <tt>Enter</tt> or <tt>Tab</tt>.
Separate labels with space. There is no need to write in uppercase, it is automatically converted to uppercase when you write.
You can go to the previous word with <tt>Shift-tab</tt>.

<h3>Reverting</h3>
To do a <i>local undo</i>, that is restore to the learner text at a specific position in the normalised text,
put the cursor where you want to revert (or select a range). Press the revert button.
You can also use <tt>ctrl-r</tt> or right-click directly in the graph.

<h3>Labelling many words</h3>
Finally, if you want to put a label on many words you first connect them pressing that button (or <tt>ctrl-c</tt>).
Now the label will stretch all words.
