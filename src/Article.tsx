    ## Alignment procedure

    Initially we start with the target being equal to the source:

    ${L.Ladder(full.g0)}

    We want to edit the target text like it were in an input text box without
    considering that the tokens in the text is part of a linked structure.

    If we just edit it by changing it we get:

    ${L.Ladder(full.g)}

    Most of it is correct. How has this happened?
    Start with a standard diff on the _character-level_:

    ${L.Ladder(full.g_unlab)}

    Here semicolon represents space. How do we now reflect this to the token level?
    By identifying each character with the token it originated from. We name them
    _s0_, _s1_, ... for the source tokens and _t0_, _t1_, ... for the target tokens.
    We don't identify the spaces with anything. The diff with each character link
    associated with the ids it is related to looks like this:

    ${L.Ladder(full.g_label)}

    We now read off from this which tokens should be aligned, namely into these six groups:

    | group | token identifiers | source words | target words |
    | ---   | ---               | ---          | ---          |
    | 1     | s0 t0             | Examples     | Examples     |
    | 2     | t1                |              | always       |
    | 3     | s1 s2 t2          | high light   | highlight    |
    | 4     | s3 t3 t4          | lotsof       | lots of      |
    | 5     | s4  t5            | futures      | features     |
    | 6     | s5                | always       |              |

    Writing parallell corpora this way is sometimes called standoff and is used in tools like Falco.

    ### Manual alignment

    The user corrects incorrect aligments in one of two ways:

    * _preemptively_ by manually moving the word by drag and drop in the graph (or similar techniques)
    * _as a fix-up stage_ by adding a link by merging the two links by using the mouse in the graph

    Regardless of method in the running example will now be in a stage where part of the parallell sentences have
    one manual alignment regarding the word _always_.

    We proceed by removing that word and aligning the rest of the text automatically:

    ${L.Ladder(wo_always.g_unlab)}

    However, when we consider the identifiers as well we see that the identifiers _t1_ and _s5_ for _always_
    are skipped (because we already know how to connect these):

    ${L.Ladder(wo_always.g_label)}

    We now read off the aligments from there  to get:

    ${L.Ladder(wo_always.g)}

    We can now insert the missing words into their correct places based on position in the respective sentences
    to get the desired alignment:

    ${Align(
      'Examples high light lotsof futures always',
      'Examples always~always highlight lots of features'
    )}

    ### Editing in the presence of manual and automatic alignments

    The tokens that have been manually aligned are remembered. While the
    user edits the target hypothesis things are straight-forward as long as the
    edit is wholly in an automatic section or a manual section. When
    editing across these boundaries the manual segment is contagious and
    extends as much as it need be.

    Thus if we select _always highlight_ and replace it with _alwayXighligt_ the states before and after are these:

    ${Align(
      'Examples high light lotsof futures always',
      'Examples always~always highlight lots of features'
    )}

    ${Align(
      'Examples high light lotsof futures always',
      'Examples alwayXighlight~high~light~always lots of features'
    )}

    However, if we across the boundary of _of features_ to _oXeatures_ we get:

    ${Align(
      'Examples high light lotsof futures always',
      'Examples always~always highlight lots oXeatures'
    )}

    Here the edit was not contagious: the automatic alignment decided to
    not make a big component, instead it chose to split to align the words independently.

    An editor with such information about what is manually aligned and automatic aligned need
    a way to untag something as manually aligned to make it fall back to the automatic aligner
    in case it has absorbed too much.

    # Mostly Automatic Word Alignment of Parallel Corpora

    _Dan Ros√©n dan.rosen@svenska.gu.se 2018_

    An error-corrected learner text can be seen as a parallel corpora from
    the source text written by the learner to target hypothesis text. We
    would like precise word alignments between these two texts and develop
    an editor which aligns these automatically and lets the user manually
    link the (unevitable) mistakes from the automatic alignment. We note
    that the situation is not exclusive to learner corpora but could be
    viable between other language pairs given that they are similar enough,
    for example the Scandinavian languages.

    Here is a hypothetical example of such an alignment:

    ${Align(
      'Examples high light lotsof futures always',
      'Examples always~always highlight lots of features'
    )}

    A natural place to put annotations is on the edges of these:

    ${Align(
      "Examples high light:undercompound lotsof:overcompound futures:'ortography||word choice' always:'word order'",
      'Examples always~always highlight lots~lotsof of~lotsof features'
    )}

    We will not focus more about such labels in this text but simply highlight
    that this is a possibility.
  `

  const future = md`
    ## Future work

    Automatic alignment could be based on something but character-level diffs. A
    token-based diff could be used where the distance between tokens are
    calculated between word embeddings in a shared embedding space for the
    two languages.

    The visualisation can be rotated 90 degrees to work with sentence-aligned
    parallell corpora.
